    Categorize a software license into a trustworthiness rating.

    This function classifies a given license name as one of the following categories:
    - ✅ Trusted: Common permissive licenses like MIT, Apache, BSD, or PSF.
    - ⚠️ Caution: Less permissive licenses like LGPL or MPL.
    - ❌ Risky: Restrictive licenses like GPL, AGPL, or unknown/ambiguous types.
    - ⚠️ Unknown: If the license does not match any known patterns.

    The classification is based on substring matches in the uppercase form 
    of the license name.

    Args:
        license_name (str): The normalized license name to rate.

    Returns:
        str: A visual indicator and label of the license rating.
